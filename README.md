Use the arrow keys to control your character. Once you enter a stall, click the item you wish to purchase and/or the dialogue you wish to say to the shopkeeper.

You will be able to build your reputation depending on the dialogue choices you make. If you are respectful of Moroccan social norms, you will have a higher reputation and a higher chance of getting a good discount.
